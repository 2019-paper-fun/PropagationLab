# PropagationLab

PropagationLab is a collection of [Icy](http://icy.bioimageanalysis.org/)
 plugins to model light propagation in a microscope.
 
These plugins are:
- `PlaneWave`: generate a plane wave
- `Propagate`: propagate a wave
- `PupilFunction`; generate a pupil function
- `Pupil2PSF`: generate a 3D diffraction PSF from a given pupil function
- `FourierTransform`
- `complex convert`
- `complex multiplication`
- `fftshift

In the example folder, these plugins are used in `icy protocols` to model several phenomena and setup for educationnal purpose.
